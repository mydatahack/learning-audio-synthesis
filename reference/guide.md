# List

Can we explain what they are?

- Herts
- Oscillator
- LFOs
- Ring Modulator
- Portmanteau

<details>
  <summary>(1) Hertz</summary>
  One hertz simply means "one event per second"
</details>

<details>
  <summary>(2) LFOs</summary>
  The oscillator of an LFO is of low frequency, usually below 20HZ â€“ and therefore out of the range of human listening. It is different from the oscillator that generates synth sound.
